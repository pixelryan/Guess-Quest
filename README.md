# Guess-Quest
 ## Overview
Welcome to the Higher or Lower card guessing game! Test your luck by guessing if the next card in a deck will be higher or lower than the current one. Each correct guess gets a point, and if you get on a streak your score goes up by even more. Go for a high score, then try to beat that record!

 ## Features
 - **Simple and Intuitive Gameplay** Players make a choice by pressing one of two buttons based on their predicition.
 - **Streak System** Consecutive correct guesses lead to higher streaks, increasing the amount of points earned by your streak count.
 - **Fantasy-Themed Graphics** Uniquely made fantasy inspired graphics.
