# Guess-Quest

## Introduction
Hello! This is a personal project developed over one day. I had to quickly come up with a simple  but fun game, design the UI/UX, and  implement the code in C#. I wanted to not just be a simple win and lose scenario, so I added a Streak system. This feature truly brought the game to life; during a playtest to fix a bug, I found myself playing "one last time" to try and beat a high score just for the challenge of it!

 ## Overview
Welcome to the Higher or Lower card guessing game! Test your luck by guessing if the next card in a deck will be higher or lower than the current one. Each correct guess gets a point, and if you get on a streak your score goes up by even more. Go for a high score, then try to beat that record!

 ## Features
 - **Simple and Intuitive Gameplay** Players make a choice by pressing one of two buttons based on their predicition.
 - **Streak System** Consecutive correct guesses lead to higher streaks, increasing the amount of points earned by your streak count.
 - **Fantasy-Themed Graphics** Uniquely made fantasy inspired graphics.
 - **Sound Effects** Hear a random flick of the cards every draw, and casino inspired win and lose sounds.
 - **Score Tracking** Keep track of the player's local high score, and longest streak of the current game.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game** Launch the game in Unity or browse to the Web build.
2. **Make Your Guess** Look at the displayed card and decide if you think the next card will be higher or lower.
3. **Choose Higher or Lower** Click the "Higher" or "Lower" button based on your choice to draw the next card.
4. **Build Your Streak** Each correct guess increases your streak.

## Rules
- **Correct Guess** Each correct guess increases your streak count. The higher the streak count, the more points you score.
- **Incorrect Guess** An incorrect guess resets your streak and deducts a life.
- **Three Lives** You have three lives represented by Hearts. Run out of lives and its Game Over.
- **PRO TIP** Aces count as 1.
- **Special Draws** The game will never draw a card of the same rank to prevent ties.
